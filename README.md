# Sentiment-Analysis

The project seeks to understand the overall demand for labour in the Armenian online job market from the 19,000 job postings from 2004 to 2015 posted on CareerCenter, an Armenian human resource portal. Through text mining on this data, we will be able to understand the nature of the ever-changing job market, as well as the overall demand for labour in the Armenia economy. The data was originally scraped from a Yahoo! Mailing group.
